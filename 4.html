      <p><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chungking_Express" target="_blank" title="중경삼림">Chungking Express</a></strong></li><br>Chungking Express is a 1994 Hong Kong crime thriller romantic comedy film written and directed by Wong Kar-wai. The film consists of two stories told in sequence, each about a lovesick Hong Kong policeman mulling over his relationship with a woman. The first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed with his breakup with a woman named May, and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler (Brigitte Lin). The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend (Valerie Chow) by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker (Faye Wong).<br>
      "Chungking" in the title refers to Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, where Wong grew up in the 1960s. "Express" refers to the food stand Midnight Express, located in Lan Kwai Fong, an area in Central, Hong Kong.</p>
      <p><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Mood_for_Love" target="_blank" title="화양연화">In the Mood for Love</a></strong></li><br>In the Mood for Love is a 2000 Hong Kong romantic drama film written, produced, and directed by Wong Kar-wai. Its original Chinese title means "Flowery Years". It tells the story of a man (played by Tony Leung) and a woman (Maggie Cheung) whose spouses have an affair together and who slowly develop feelings for each other.<br>
      In the Mood for Love premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 20 May, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and Tony Leung was awarded Best Actor (the first Hong Kong actor to win this award at Cannes). It is frequently listed as one of the greatest films of all time and one of the major works of Asian cinema. In a 2016 survey by the BBC, it was voted the second-best film of the 21st century by 177 film critics from around the world.</p>
